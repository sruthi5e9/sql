LEFT JOIN customers b -- alternatively use LEFT OUTER JOIN instead of LEFT JOIN
ON a.Customer_Number = b.Customer_Number;

RIGHT OUTER JOIN

SELECT
  a.Order_Number,
  b.Customer_Name,
  b.Postal_Code
FROM orders a
RIGHT JOIN customers b -- alternatively use RIGHT OUTER JOIN instead of RIGHT JOIN
ON a.Customer_Number = b.Customer_Number;

FULL OUTER JOIN

SELECT
  a.Order_Number,
  b.Customer_Name,
  b.Postal_Code
FROM orders a
FULL JOIN customers b --alternatively use ‘FULL OUTER JOIN’ instead of ‘FULL JOIN’
ON a.Customer_Number = b.Customer_Number;

Difference Between INNER and OUTER JOIN:::
As you might have figured out, the key difference between INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN is whether to include the rows for which we don’t have a match in the other table. 
While an INNER JOIN only returns rows where there is a match between the two tables, an OUTER JOIN (depending on the type) also returns those rows for which there is no matching row in the other table.
