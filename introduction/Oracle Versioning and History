Oracle Database Version History

Oracle was founded on June 16, 1977 by Larry Ellison, Bob Miner and Ed Oates under the name Software Development Laboratories (SDL). 
Until 1979, the company did not succeed with this name, and in 1979, three adventurous friends who changed the company name to Relational Software Inc worked in Relational Software Inc. until 1982. 
The brilliant trio, which has consistently focused on Database management systems and made its first database trial with IBM, failed.

In one of the following experiments, the Oracle Database System developed under the leadership of Bob Miner. 
In 1982, the name of the company was identified with the name of its products and changed to Oracle Systems Corporation. 
It was changed to Oracle Corporation in 1995 and this name has continued to this day.
