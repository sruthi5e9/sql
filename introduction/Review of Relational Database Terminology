Database: a collection of data/information, organized together in such a manner so that they can accessed easily and successfully. In a relational database, this data is organized into Tables.
Table: a group of Records, each representing the same sort of data.
Record: also known as a row in a Table. Each row in a table is distinct, but all share a common set of Fields. All rows have the same kind of data, but refer to unique Records.
Field: also known as columns in a Table; (in Excel, the field names are what you would use for column headings)
Parse: to separate out the data into appropriate columns or fields; in Excel, the function Data / Text to Columns parses the file into Records (by rows) and Fields (by columns)
Delimiter: the character used to differentiate among the fields in a Record
Data entry: Creating, updating, and deleting records (Insert and Update Queries): in Excel, this can be done in the spreadsheet directly or using GUI interfaces
Sort: when the data are re-written in a specific order
Sort keys (primary, secondary, tertiary sort keys): the fields (first, second, third ...) fields used to determine the sort order
Selection: selecting a subset of the records; in Excel, one can use the Filters to select sets of records
Selection criteria: the criteria for using a Filter or for use with the Excel database functions
Filter: Complies with a data selection by "hiding" data that do not meet the stated criteria
Query: determining the data selection and/or sort and/or any calculations to be performed on the data
Aggregate functions in a query: as seen in the Excel database functions
