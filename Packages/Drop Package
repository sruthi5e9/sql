Drop Package â€“ illustrate how to drop a PL/SQL package.

The DROP PACKAGE statement drops a stored package from the database.
Semantics
drop_package

drop package pk_580;

BODY

Drops only the body of the package. If you omit this clause, then the database drops both the body and specification of the package.

When you drop only the body of a package but not its specification, the database does not invalidate dependent objects.
However, you cannot invoke a procedure or stored function declared in the package specification until you re-create the package body.

schema

Name of the schema containing the package. Default: your schema.

package

Name of the package to be dropped.

The database invalidates any local objects that depend on the package specification.
If you subsequently reference one of these objects, then the database tries to recompile the object and returns an error 
if you have not re-created the dropped package.

If any statistics types are associated with the package, then the database disassociates the statistics
types with the FORCE clause and drops any user-defined statistics collected with the statistics types.
