What is PL/SQL –  introduce you to PL/SQL programming language and its architecture.

PL/SQL or Procedural Language for SQL is an extended version of SQL programming, designed specifically by Oracle for its relational databases, 
to be programmed alongside SQL and Java. As a programming language, it is derived from SQL and incorporates object-oriented programming (OOPS) concepts such as 
procedures, functions, loops, conditional statements, etc. 
Also, this programming language consents to variables & constants declaration, similar to Java and other OOPS based programming languages.

PL/SQL is an extension of SQL that allows developers to combine the power of SQL with procedural statements. 
Oracle Corporation developed it in the early ’90s. It allows writing a piece of code, including the SQL query in a block (which is the basic unit of it).

It is a high standard and readable language, so it is very easy to understand and learn. 
It can only be used with Oracle Database Systems and cannot be used as a standalone application like C, C++, Java, etc. 
It provides the facility to developers to use loops, conditions, object-oriented concepts and SQL like other database languages.

Before this, only one query is sent to the Oracle server, which increases the load and time. 
But through this, multiple SQL statements are grouped and sent in a single block or subprogram, which increases the processing speed and decreases the traffic on 
Oracle Server.
