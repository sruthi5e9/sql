INSTEAD OF triggers â€“ learn how to use the INSTEAD OF triggers to update tables via their views which cannot be modified directly through DML statements.

An INSTEAD OF trigger is a trigger that allows you to skip an INSERT, DELETE, or UPDATE statement to a table or a view and execute other statements defined in the 
trigger instead. 
The actual insert, delete, or update operation does not occur at all.

SYNTAX::
-------
CREATE TRIGGER [schema_name.] trigger_name
ON {table_name | view_name }
INSTEAD OF {[INSERT] [,] [UPDATE] [,] [DELETE] }
AS
{sql_statements}

EXAMPLE::
---------
CREATE TRIGGER production.trg_vw_brands 
ON production.vw_brands
INSTEAD OF INSERT
AS
BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT ON;
    INSERT INTO production.brand_approvals ( 
        brand_name
    )
    SELECT
        i.brand_name
    FROM
        inserted i
    WHERE
        i.brand_name NOT IN (
            SELECT 
                brand_name
            FROM
                production.brands
        );
END
